# Stream Concepts



### Some highlights of Kafka Streams:

- Designed as a **simple and lightweight client library**, which can be easily embedded in any Java application and integrated with any existing packaging, deployment and operational tools that users have for their streaming applications.

  ```
  设计为简单和轻量级的客户端库
  ```

- Has **no external dependencies on systems other than Apache Kafka itself** as the internal messaging layer; notably, it uses Kafka's partitioning model to horizontally scale processing while maintaining strong ordering guarantees.

  ```
  除了Kafka内部的消息传递层外，没有任何外部依赖。
  ```

- Supports **fault-tolerant local state**, which enables very fast and efficient stateful operations like windowed joins and aggregations.

  ```
  支持容错本地状态，这可以实现非常快速和高效的有状态操作，例如窗口连接和聚合。
  ```

- Supports **exactly-once** processing semantics to guarantee that each record will be processed once and only once even when there is a failure on either Streams clients or Kafka brokers in the middle of processing.

  ```
  支持一次精确的处理意义，以确保即使在流客户端或者kafka brokers在处理中出现错误时，每个记录也只会被处理一次。
  ```

- Employs **one-record-at-a-time processing** to achieve millisecond processing latency, and supports **event-time based windowing operations** with out-of-order arrival of records.

  ```
  采用一次一个记录的处理以实现毫秒级处理延迟，并支持以事件时间为基础的窗口操作以及记录的无序到达。
  ```

- Offers necessary stream processing primitives, along with a **high-level Streams DSL** and a **low-level Processor API**.

  ```
  提供必要的流处理原语，以及高级的 StreamsDSL 和 低级的 Processor Api
  ```



### Stream processing Topology（流处理拓扑）

- A stream is the most important abstraction provided by Kafka Streams: it represents an un bounded, continuously updating data set. A stream is an ordered, replayable, and fault-tolerant sequence of immutable data records, where a data record is defined as a key-value pair.

  ```
  流是kafka Streams 提供的一个重要的概念：它是一个无限的、不停更新的数据集，它是有序的、可重播和容错序列，其中数据记录被定义为键值对;
  ```

- A stream processing application is any program that makes use of Kafka Streams library. it defines its computational logic through one or more processor topologies, where a processor topology is graph of   stream processors(nodes) that are connected by streams(edges).

  ```
  流处理应用是使用Kafka Streams库的任何程序。他通过一个或多个处理器拓扑定义计算逻辑，其中处理器拓扑是由流(边)连接的流处理器（节点）的图.
  ```

- A stream processor is a node in the processor topology; it represents a processing step to transform data in streams by receiving one input record at a time from **its** upstream processors in the topology, applying its operation to it, and may subsequently produce one or more output records to its downstream processors.

  ```
  流处理器是一个处理器拓扑中的一个节点，它代表通过上游处理器接受一条输入记录来转换流中数据的处理步骤，对其应用操作，然后可能生产一个或多个输出记录到下游处理器。
  ```

#### there are two special processors in the topology:

- **Source Processor**: A source processor is special type of stream processor that does not have any upstream processors. it produces an input stream to its topology from one or more multiple Kafka topics by consuming records from there topics and forwarding them to its down-streams processors.

  ```
  源处理器： 源处理器是一个特殊流处理器类型，它没有上游处理器。它通过使用一个或多个Kafka 主题中的记录，并将它们转发到其下游处理器，从而从一个或多个Kafka 主题中生成拓扑结构的输入流
  ```

- **Sink Processor:** A sink processor is special type of stream processor that does not have and downstream processors. it sends any received records from its up-stream processors to a specified Kafka topic.

  ```
  sink 处理器一个特殊的流处理器类型，它没有下游处理器。它将所有从上游处理器中接受到的记录发送到指定地topic中。
  ```

Kafka Streams offers two ways to define the stream processing topology;

- **Kafka Streams DSL** provides the most common data transformation operations such as `map`, `filter`, `join` and `aggregations` out of the box; 
- Processor API: lower-level, allows developers define and connect custom processors as well as to interact with state stores.

```
 低级的API 在处理状态存储时有更大的灵活性。不过，在DSL 中也可以嵌入低级API。
```

A processor topology is merely a logical abstraction for your stream processing code. At runtime, the logical topology is instantiated and replicated inside the application for parallel processing

```
处理器拓扑仅仅是流处理代码上的逻辑抽象。在运行时，逻辑拓扑是被实例化并被复制到应用程序内部进行并行处理的。（会在结构篇中详细讲述）
```

### Time

A criticak aspect in stream processing is the notion of time, and how it is modeled and integrated. For example, some operations such as windowing are defined based on time boundaries.
